            <p>
                During my internship, I developed a Recruitment Management System to streamline the hiring process with features
                like role-based access control for HR, interviewers, and technical panels. HR could create detailed job
                postings, and candidates could apply, with applications routed to interviewers for screening and technical
                evaluations. Interviewers provided feedback, and candidate statuses were updated accordingly. A dynamic
                dashboard displayed insights such as job-wise applications, selection metrics, and hiring process charts. The
                system also included features like interview notifications, user activity tracking, and permission-based access
                to ensure smooth operations and secure data management.
